        title: '"Find Someone Who..."',
        instructions: `"Find Someone Who" is a classic ESL activity that encourages students to interact and practice 
        their questioning and answering skills in English. In this activity, students are given a 
        worksheet with various statements or prompts. They must move around the classroom and talk 
        to their classmates to find someone who matches each statement. For example, "Find someone 
        who has been to Europe" requires the student to ask their peers about their travel experiences. 
        It's a great way to get students speaking and to learn more about each other!`
